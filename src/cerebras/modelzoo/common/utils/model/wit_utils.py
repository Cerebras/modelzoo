"""
This module provides a PyTorch-level API for Wafer Instruction Tuning (WIT).

WIT allows users to control the behavior of the ML compiler by annotating function closures. 
Through this API, users can specify whether a function closure should be optimized by the 
scheduling algorithm or through common subexpression elimination (CSE). 

The primary components of this module include:
- `WitConfig`: A configuration class for enabling or disabling schedule optimization 
  and CSE within annotated closures.
- `wafer_instruction_tuning`: A Python decorator for annotating checkpoint operations for the recompute algorithm. 
  This ensures that the annotated operation includes the "wit" attribute in the compiler's 
  internal representation.

This API is designed to provide fine-grained control over compiler optimizations, enabling 
users to tailor the behavior of the ML compiler to their specific needs.

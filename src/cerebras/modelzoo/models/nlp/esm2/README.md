# ESM-2: Evolutionary Scale Modeling for Protein Language

ESM-2 (Evolutionary Scale Modeling) is a family of transformer-based protein language models developed by Meta AI's Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) Protein Team. Trained on large-scale protein sequence datasets such as UniRef50, ESM-2 learns representations that encode structural and functional information about proteins without requiring evolutionary alignments.

For more information on using our ESM-2 implementation, visit its [model page](https://training-docs.cerebras.ai/rel-2.5.0/model-zoo/models/nlp/esm2) in our documentation.

# GPT-J, GPT-Neox

GPT-J and GPT-Neox are families of decoder-only language models developed by EleutherAI and trained on the [Pile](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00027) dataset â€” a curated mixture of diverse text sources. Both models are designed to be efficient, flexible, and performant in zero-shot settings.

# Jais

Jais is based on a transformer-based decoder-only (GPT-3) architecture and uses SwiGLU non-linearity. It implements ALiBi position embeddings, enabling the model to extrapolate to long sequence lengths, providing improved context handling and model precision. For more information, see the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16149).

For more information on using Jais, visit its [model page](https://training-docs.cerebras.ai/rel-2.5.0/model-zoo/models/nlp/jais) in our documentation.

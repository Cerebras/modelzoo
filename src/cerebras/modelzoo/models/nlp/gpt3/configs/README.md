# Config params for GPT3 model

**NOTE**: This readme is for internal use only.

This folder contains a list of YAML files for the model configs that are ready to be released into [ModelZoo](https://github.com/Cerebras/modelzoo).

All the configs inside [qa](../qa) are used by QA team. There should be a 1:1 correspondence between the files in `qa` and this folder.

When editing or adding any file in this folder, please make sure if the base params in the corresponding version in [qa](../qa) directory also needs an update or add it if it doesn't exist.

All the configs outside of this in [configs](../) are the ones that are currently under bring-up or internal use only.

# Overview of the FC-MNIST model

A simple multi-layer perceptron model composed of fully-connected layers
for performing handwriting recognition on the MNIST dataset.
The model is a `3`-layer multi-layer perceptron. The first layer has hidden
size `500`, the second `300`, and the third layer has `num_classes` number of
hidden units (which here is `10`). It then trains on a categorical cross entropy
loss. This structure is based on the survey of different structures on the
MNIST website [ref #2](#references).

# Sequence of the steps to perform
See the following diagram:

# Structure of the code
* `data.py`: Defines the MNIST data processor
* `model.py`: Model implementation. 
* `configs/params.yaml`: Example of a YAML configurations file.
* `run.py`: Train script, performs training and validation.
* `utils.py`: Miscellaneous helper functions.

# Dataset and input pipeline

The MNIST dataset comes from `torchvision.datasets`. The train dataset
has a size of `60,000` and the eval dataset `10,000` images.
More information can be found on the
[PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/vision/0.8/datasets.html#mnist).
Each sample in the dataset is a black and white image of size `28x28`, where
each pixel is an integer from `0 to 255` inclusive.

Dataset can be downloaded using the [`prepare_data.py`](prepare_data.py) and it should be set to the `data_dir` path provided in [`configs/params.yaml`](./configs/params.yaml). <br />

The input pipeline does minimal processing on this dataset. The dataset returns one batch at a time, of the form:
```
inputs = (
    features = Tensor(size=(batch_size, 28*28), dtype=torch.floatX,
    labels = Tensor(size=(batch_size,), dtype=torch.int32,
)
```
Where here, `torch.floatX = torch.float32` if we are running in full precision and float16 if we are running in mixed precision mode. You can simply set the mixed precision mode by passing `model.mixed_precision False` as part of the arguments.

# How to run:

## To compile/validate, run train and eval on Cerebras System

Please follow the instructions on our [quickstart in the Developer Docs](https://docs.cerebras.net/en/latest/wsc/getting-started/cs-appliance.html).

## To run train and eval on GPU/CPU

If running on a cpu or gpu, activate the environment from [Python GPU Environment setup](../../../../../PYTHON-SETUP.md), and simply run:

```bash
python run.py {CPU,GPU} --mode train --params configs/params.yaml
```

If run outside of the Cerebras environment with `--mode train`, it will skip validation and compilation steps and proceed straight to the training on your allocated hardware.


# Configurations included for this model
In the [configs](./configs/) directory we have config files to train FC-MNIST model.
    * [params.yaml](./configs/params.yaml) with `depth=10`, `hidden_size=50`, and `SGD` optimizer.

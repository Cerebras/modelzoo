The Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture applies transformer-based modeling, originally developed for NLP, to sequences of image patches for visual tasks. Instead of using convolutional layers, ViT treats an image as a sequence of non-overlapping patches, embeds them, and feeds them into a standard transformer encoder.

This implementation supports ViT models of various sizes trained on ImageNet-1K and provides flexible configuration options for patch sizes, model depth, and hidden dimensions. The transformer layers operate over patch embeddings with added positional information, enabling strong performance in image classification tasks when pretrained on large datasets.

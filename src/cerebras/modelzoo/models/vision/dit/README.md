# Diffusion Transformer

This directory contains implementation for Diffusion Transformer (DiT). Diffusion Transformer, as the name suggests, belongs to the class of diffusion models. However, the key difference is that it replaces the UNet architecture backbone typically used in previous diffusion models with a Transformer backbone and some modifications. This model beats the previous diffusion models in FID-50K eval metric.

For more information on using our DiT implementation, visit its [model page](https://training-docs.cerebras.ai/rel-2.5.0/model-zoo/models/vision/dit) in our documentation.
